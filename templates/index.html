<p>Ever ended up in a hostel with a high rating on Hostelworld but had a terrible experience? Me too! Having travelled across the world and stayed in 100â€™s of hostels I noticed:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Travellers may leave a good rating for a hostel and then express their issues with the hostel in the text review</li>
  <li>Hostelworld use certain aspects of your stay to calculate an overall rating. Some travellers may have had a terrible experience overall but still give aspects such as location or staff a good rating which may falsely lead to a high rating. In this case the text review is likely to be more informative than the rating </li>
  <li>Old reviews of a hostel may no longer be relevant but still contribute to the overall rating. Recent text reviews are most accurate</li>
  <li>To get the true feel of the positives and negatives of a hostel you have to read through multiple text reviews</li>
 </ul>
 <p>HW-Reviews analyses the text reviews of a hostel you are interested to give you true insight into previous travellers experiences.</p>
